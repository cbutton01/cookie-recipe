    <p>This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family.  The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!

    <p>The word cookie originally came from the Dutch keokje, meaning "little cake." In addition, the Dutch first popularized cookies in the United States. The British took a liking to them in the 19th century, incorporating them into their daily tea service and calling them biscuits or sweet buns, as they do in Scotland.
